=begin
Write function that takes two integers m and n respectively. The function should flip the nth bit of m, counting from the LSB and return the resulting value.\By flip, the interviewer meant change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. For instance, if you were passed in 8 and 3. 
Convert 8 to binary and you have 1000, now we flip the 3rd bit and we have 1100, then we convert this back to decimal(which would be 12)and return the answer.
